<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Currently this contains text describing our project from our <a href="https://github.com/greenelab/czi-rfa/blob/master/proposal.md">initial proposal</a>.</p>
<p>The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) aims to provide a comprehensive map of all types of human cells. Connecting that map to disease states, which will be key to the CZI’s mission of curing or managing all diseases in the next eighty years, will require us to see how these cell types change during aging, during disease processes, or in the presence of drugs. Ideally, we’d be able to apply a transformation to the HCA’s reference map to predict and study these states.</p>
<p>Certain types of deep neural networks can generate hypothetical data by learning and decoding a lower dimensional latent space. An ideal latent space enables arithmetic operations that use data to produce realistic output for novel transformations. For example, FaceApp <span class="citation" data-cites="11SweunvY">[<a href="#ref-11SweunvY">1</a>]</span> can modify a picture of an individual to produce an image of the subject at an older age, with a different expression, or of a different gender.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this proposal is to determine how unsupervised deep neural network models can best be trained on single cell expression data from the HCA and the extent to which such models define biological latent spaces that capture disease states and targeted perturbations. The rationale is that latent space arithmetic for single cell transcriptomes would enable researchers to use predict how the expression of every gene would change in each HCA-identified cell type in numerous conditions including after drug treatment, in the context of a specific genetic variant, with a specific disease, or a combination of these and other factors.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Certain deep neural networks can generate hypothetical data by learning and decoding a lower dimensional latent space. This latent space enables arithmetic operations that produce realistic output for novel transformations. This allows users to generate hypothetical images <span class="citation" data-cites="mSTbr0cw">[<a href="#ref-mSTbr0cw">2</a>]</span> and to interpolate protein localizations through the cell-cycle <span class="citation" data-cites="zBCcUQOM">[<a href="#ref-zBCcUQOM">3</a>]</span>. An accessible example of latent space transformations comes from FaceApp <span class="citation" data-cites="11SweunvY">[<a href="#ref-11SweunvY">1</a>]</span>, which modifies a picture of an individual to produce an image of the subject at an older age, with a different expression, or of a different genders.</p>
<p>Our <em>overall objective</em> is to determine how unsupervised deep neural network models can best be trained on single cell expression data from the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) and the extent to which such models define biological latent spaces that capture disease states and targeted perturbations. The <em>rationale</em> is that latent space arithmetic for genomic data would enable researchers to predict how the expression of every gene would change in each HCA-identified cell type after drug treatment, in the context of a specific genetic variant, with a specific disease, or a combination of these and other factors.</p>
<h3 id="prior-contributions-preliminary-results">Prior Contributions / Preliminary Results</h3>
<p>We previously developed neural-network based methods for unsupervised integration of transcriptomic data <span class="citation" data-cites="1CFhfCyWN">[<a href="#ref-1CFhfCyWN">4</a>]</span>. We now build to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) which have a track record of defining meaningful latent spaces for images. We adapted GANs to generate realistic individuals under a differential privacy framework <span class="citation" data-cites="fbIH12yd">[<a href="#ref-fbIH12yd">7</a>]</span> and built VAEs over bulk transcriptomic data with the goal of describing a biologically-relevant latent space <span class="citation" data-cites="aWn0df1m">[<a href="#ref-aWn0df1m">8</a>]</span>. Here, we will apply these unsupervised deep learning methods to single cell transcriptomic data and incorporate novel data augmentation approaches for genomics. We also bring workflow automation experience to the HCA community <span class="citation" data-cites="Qh7xTLwz">[<a href="#ref-Qh7xTLwz">9</a>]</span>.</p>

<h3 id="proposed-work">Proposed work</h3>
<p>The <em>objective of this aim</em> is to implement and test approaches to build deep generative models, such as VAEs <span class="citation" data-cites="NLVTJ9Lj">[<a href="#ref-NLVTJ9Lj">10</a>]</span> and GANs <span class="citation" data-cites="dXnSD8tJ">[<a href="#ref-dXnSD8tJ">11</a>]</span>, from HCA single cell RNA-seq data.</p>
<p>Single cell data pose unique opportunities, but also challenges, for deep neural network algorithms. Many cells are often assayed, and many observations are needed to use deep learning effectively. However, transcript abundance estimates for each cell are generally subject to more error than bulk samples.</p>
<p>In our experience with generative deep learning <span class="citation" data-cites="fbIH12yd">[<a href="#ref-fbIH12yd">7</a>]</span> it can be difficult to predict optimal parameters in advance. We will perform a grid search over VAE architectures and hyperparameters to identify suitable options. We will evaluate zero-inflated loss among more traditional loss functions, as Chris Probert noted potential benefits on our proposal’s GitHub repository <span class="citation" data-cites="ufUaIy3V">[<a href="#ref-ufUaIy3V">12</a>]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="13Q8I0ueY">[<a href="#ref-13Q8I0ueY">13</a>]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="6Dv4X61k">[<a href="#ref-6Dv4X61k">14</a>]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="zALrucGv">[<a href="#ref-zALrucGv">15</a>]</span>]. This process will identify a subset of parameters and architectures that are worth exploring further for single cells.</p>
<p>We will also develop data augmentation for single cell RNA-seq data, as no such approaches exist yet for transcriptomes. To understand data augmentation, imagine scanned pathology slides. Each slide may be prepared and scanned with a subtly different orientation or magnification. A deep learning method may identify these measurement differences, or there may be too few slides to train a good model. Applying arbitrary rotations, zooms, and other irrelevant transformations increases the effective amount of training data and reduces the model’s propensity to learn such noise.</p>
<p>We plan to use fast abundance estimates for RNA-seq <span class="citation" data-cites="vrqQcFyx">[<a href="#ref-vrqQcFyx">16</a>]</span> to perform data augmentation for transcriptomes. Multiple resamples or subsamples of reads during transcript abundance estimation can capture uncertainty in the data, akin to arbitrary rotations. Therefore, we plan to collaborate with Rob Patro’s laboratory (Collaborative Network) to implement these and related approaches. We posit that genomic data augmentation will improve latent feature generalization by separating biological from technical features and increasing the effective sample size during training.</p>
<p>We will select high-quality models by choosing those that minimize both reconstruction loss and KL divergence <span class="citation" data-cites="NLVTJ9Lj">[<a href="#ref-NLVTJ9Lj">10</a>]</span>. We will evaluate resulting models for their applicability to rheumatic disease and their suitability for latent space arithmetic (see: Evaluation).</p>

Visualization of simulated single cell data using VAE_depth2 (2 hidden layer), VAE_depth1 (1 hidden layer), t-SNE and PCA under different parameters</h5>
<p>To see if different methods can recover cell types, we compared the 2D visualizations on simulated datasets. 2-layer VAE performs much better to differentiate different cell types when comparing with 1-layer VAE. The performance of VAE and t-SNE is similar and much better than PCA, but with the increase of outlier genes, 2-layer VAE is more resistant to noise.</p>

<p>We tested the performance of VAE and another 4 methods (t-SNE <span class="citation" data-cites="Mij5zdMT">[<a href="#ref-Mij5zdMT">26</a>]</span>, ZIFA <span class="citation" data-cites="13Q8I0ueY">[<a href="#ref-13Q8I0ueY">13</a>]</span>, UMAP <span class="citation" data-cites="157h5hA34">[<a href="#ref-157h5hA34">27</a>]</span> and PCA <span class="citation" data-cites="1B69QdM07">[<a href="#ref-1B69QdM07">29</a>]</span>) on these real datasets with different number of cells, genes and cell types. Figure 4 shows the 2-D visulization of the real single cell datasets. PCA and ZIFA generally perform better when number of cells is small, but with the increase of number of cells, VAE better differentiates different cell types. Increase of VAE depth does not significantly change the performance for real single cell datasets, but for the simulated data we analyzed above, VAE with higher depth is more resistant to noise and performs better with small number of cells.</p>

<h5 id="performance-evaluation">3. Performance evaluation</h5>
<p>Evaluation of model performance is based on three different types of metrics: clustering based, average silhouette score and knn-based.</p>
<p><em>Clustering based approach</em>: k-means clustering was performed based on the latent space, the model performance was measured by NMI and ARI.</p>

<p>Figure 5: Performance comparison among VAE, t-SNE, ZIFA, UMAP and PCA based on k-means. For dataset with fewer cells, the performance of t-SNE, umap, ZIFA and PCA is better than VAE. VAE and umap outperforms t-SNE, ZIFA and PCA whith increase number of cells.</p>
<p><em>Average silhouette score</em>: average silhouette score measures how well each points lies with its own cluster, which indicates the separability of each inidividual cluster. The value of average silluetee score is between -1 to 1, with 1 means the cluster is far away from its neighboring clusters.</p>

<p>Figure 6: Performance comparison among VAE, t-SNE, ZIFA, UMAP and PCA based on Average silhouette score. The average silluetee score does not differ too much for different aproaches. The performance of UMAP is generally better than the other approaches.</p>
<p><em>knn-based</em>: for knn-based approach, we used k-nearest neighbor algorithm to learn the pattern based on the low dimensional latent space, then the performance of classifier was measured by 5-fold cross validation. The performance of VAE is generally better than the other approaches for majority of the real datasets.</p>

<h4 id="data-augmentation">Data augmentation</h4>
<p>We performed data augmentation based on HCA melanoma dataset. We down sampling the melanoma dataset to test the method stability. The dataset was bootstrapped with 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 cells. Salmon <span class="citation" data-cites="vrqQcFyx">[<a href="#ref-vrqQcFyx">16</a>]</span> was used to do the transcript abundance quantification and we resampled the reads by 2x, 5x and 10x times to capture the uncertainty in the data. Figure 7 and 8 show the performance of data augmentation under different conditions. K-means and Knn based performance both indicate data augmentation works well in small number of samples (100 and 500 cells), but does not contribute too much in a large sample size (2000).</p>

<h2 id="aim-2-generate-a-benchmark-dataset-of-harmonized-public-data-to-evaluate-the-extent-to-which-hca-cell-types-capture-rheumatic-disease-biology.">Aim 2: Generate a benchmark dataset of harmonized public data to evaluate the extent to which HCA cell types capture rheumatic disease biology.</h2>
<p>The HCA’s partnership with the Immunological Genome Project (immgenH) will provide single-cell gene expression-based immunocyte phenotyping at an unprecedented resolution. A compendium comprised of bulk gene expression data from autoimmune/rheumatic diseases is exceptionally well-suited to evaluating the disease relevance of these immunocyte data. The <em>objective of this aim</em> is to build and share real and simulated benchmark datasets to evaluate the quality of the cell-type signatures. This will allow CZI to evaluate techniques, including VAEs and other methods, for defining cell-type-specific expression signatures from the HCA’s single-cell datasets by measuring their ability to decompose bulk, whole-tissue autoimmune/rheumatic disease data.</p>
<p>We will generate simulated bulk datasets drawn from HCA-identified cell types by combining their expression profiles at different proportions. We will also build a multi-tissue autoimmune/rheumatic disease compendium from existing public datasets that we have curated (currently more than 12,000 samples). This compendium includes samples from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disorders among many other diseases. Such a compendium lets us determine the extent to which HCA-derived cell type signatures capture disease-relevant information in a way that matches previous literature. For instance, we expect to detect higher proportions of activated macrophages in lupus nephritis samples than controls <span class="citation" data-cites="2f2lADmF">[<a href="#ref-2f2lADmF">30</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>These bulk compendia (simulated and real data) will enable HCA participants (computational-method and molecular-assay developers) to directly compare approaches where we expect their most immediate translational impact: application to existing datasets to explain disease-relevant phenomena via a single-cell perspective.</p>
