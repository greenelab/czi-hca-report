## Abstract {.page_break_before}

We wrote an application for the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Collaborative Computational Tools RFA](https://chanzuckerberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RFA-Computational-Tools.pdf).
Our application was recommended for funding.
We are writing our progress report as we go.
This repository contains the report.
Please feel free to file a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/greenelab/czi-hca-report/issues) to ask a question.
Some elements of this report are expected to also be written up via a published manuscript.
In the event that we write a manuscript, we will begin from this report.
Authorship will be determined in accordance with [ICMJE guidelines](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html).
